--Description: Retrieve the employee ID, first name, department name, job title,-- 
--and country name of all employees along with their corresponding job title and country information. Include employees without a department.--
--Tables: EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENTS, JOBS, COUNTRIES
--Hint: Use LEFT JOIN to combine the EMPLOYEES, JOBS, and COUNTRIES tables on the corresponding columns.--
--Then use INNER JOIN to join the resulting table with the DEPARTMENTS table on the department ID column.--




select *from employees;
select *from departments;
select*from jobs;
select *from countries;
select *from locations;

select e.first_name, d.department_name
from employees e
Natural JOIN departments d
where department_name IS NULL; 

--I didn't use the Hint , in my opinion, the query should be written like that--

select e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name, j.job_title, c.country_name
from employees e
INNER JOIN jobs j
ON e.job_id=j.job_id
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id=d.department_id
INNER JOIN locations l 
ON d.location_id=l.location_id
INNER  JOIN countries c 
ON l.country_id=c.country_id;
